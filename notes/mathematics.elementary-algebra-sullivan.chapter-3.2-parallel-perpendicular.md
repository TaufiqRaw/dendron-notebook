## Parallel line
* Two **nonvertical lines** are parallel if and only if their **slopes are equal** and they have **different y-intercepts**.   
* **Vertical lines** are parallel if they have different **x-intercepts**.

## Perpendicular line
When two lines intersect at a right (90Â°) angle,
they are said to be perpendicular
>Two **nonvertical lines** are perpendicular if and only if the **product of their slopes is -1**, meaning their slope is negative reciprocals of each other.
