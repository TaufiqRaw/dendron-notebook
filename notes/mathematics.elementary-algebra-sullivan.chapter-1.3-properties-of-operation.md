## Properties of addition
* <b> Identity Property of Addition</b> For any real number a, $0 + a = a + 0 = a$
* <b>Commutative Property of Addition</b> If a and b are real numbers, then $a + b = b + a$
* <b>Additive Inverse Property</b> For any real number a, $a + (— a) = — a + a = 0$
* <b>Associative Property of Addition</b> If a, b, and c are real numbers, then $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$

## Properties of Multiplication
* <b>Identity Property of Multiplication </b>$a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a$ for any real number a.
* <b>Commutative Property of Multiplication</b> If a and b are real numbers, then $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
* <b>Multiplicative Inverse Property</b> $a \cdot \frac{1}{a} = 1 \ provided \ that \ a \neq 0$
* <b>Associative Property of Multiplication</b> If a, b, and c are real numbers, then $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$
* <b>Multiplication Property of Zero </b> For any real number a, the product of a and 0 is always 0; that is, $a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0$
* <b>Division Properties of Zero</b> For any nonzero number a,
  1. The quotient of 0 and a is 0.That is, $\frac{0}{a} = 0$
  1. The quotient of a and 0 is undefined. That is, $\frac{a}{0}$ is undefined.
