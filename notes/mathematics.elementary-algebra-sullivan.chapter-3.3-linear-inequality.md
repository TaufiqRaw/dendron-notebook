<div style="background-color:#aaaaaa12; padding:10px">

$$ 
\begin{align} 
&\ Ax+By < C \\
&\ Ax+By > C \\
&\ Ax+By \ge C \\
&\ Ax+By \le C 
\end{align}
$$

* $A, B,$ and $C$ are real numbers.
* $A$ and $B$ cannot both be 0.

two variables $x$ and $y$ is **satisfied** by an ordered pair $(a, b)$ if a **true statement** results when $x$ is replaced by $a$ and $y$ is replaced by $b$.

</div>

## Graphing
If we **replace the inequality symbol** with an **equal sign** in a linear inequality, we obtain the equation line. This **boundary line separates** the xy-plane into two regions, called **half-planes**.

Then you can test which plane is **true** by using **one point** in either plane, this called **Test point**. If this point satisfy the inequality shade the plane than contains it if not shade the other one.

Tips : use the easiest point to test, e.g. if the plane contains $(0,0)$ use it.
