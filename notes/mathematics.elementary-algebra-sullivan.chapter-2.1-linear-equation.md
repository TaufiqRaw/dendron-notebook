A linear equation in one variable is an equation that can be written in the form $ax + b = c$, where: 
* $a, b,$ and $c$ are real numbers 
* $a$ does not equal 0.

example
>* $\frac{3}{7}x-5 = \frac{2}{7}x+3$  
>* $7(x-5)+10 = 11$

The **solution** of a linear equation is the value or values of the variable that make the equation a true statement. The set of all solutions of an equation is called the **solution set**. We sometimes say that the solution satisfies the equation.

solution set from example above is $\frac{1}{7}x+7$

## Solving
We solve linear equations by writing a **series of steps** that result in the equation that equivalent (called **equivalent equations**)

### Addition Property of Equality
if $a = b$, then $a + c = b + c$
* for real numbers $a, b,$ and $c,$  

### Multiplication Property of Equality
if $a = b$, then $ac = bc$
* for real numbers $a, b,$ 
* $c,$ where $c$ does not equal 0,

**substraction** is just addition with negative number  
**division** is multiplication but using fraction

### Solving With Fraction

>\begin{align}
>\frac{7n+5}{8} &\ = 2 + \frac{3n+15}{10} \newline
>40(\frac{7n+5}{8}) &\ = 40(2 + \frac{3n+15}{10}) \newline
>40(\frac{7n+5}{8}) &\ = 40(2) + 40(\frac{3n+15}{10}) \newline
>\sout{40}(\frac{7n+5}{\sout{8}}) &\ = 80 + \sout{40}(\frac{3n+15}{\sout{10}}) \newline
>5(7n+5) &\ = 80 + 4(3n+15) \newline
>35n+25 &\ = 80 + 12n+60 \newline
>35n+25 &\ = 80 + 60 + 12n \newline
>35n+25 &\ = 140 + 12n \newline
>35n+25 -25 &\ = 140 + 12n - 25 \newline
>35n &\ = 140 - 25 + 12n \newline
>35n &\ = 115 + 12n \newline
>35n - 12n &\ = 115 + 12n - 12n \newline
>23n &\ = 115 \newline
>23n * \frac{1}{23} &\ = 115 * \frac{1}{23} \newline
>n &\ = 5 \newline

in example above the LCD of 8 an 10 is 40

Solving decimal number can also use the trick above

## Linear Equation Classification

### Conditional
A conditional equation is an equation that is true for some values of the variable and false for other values of the variable.

$x+5=11$

### Contradiction
An identity is an equation that is satisfied for all values of the variable for which both sides of the equation are defined.
$$
\begin{align}
3y - (5y + 4) &\ = 12y - 7(2y - 1) \newline
3y - 5y - 4 &\ = 12y - 14y + 7 \newline
-2y - 4 &\ = -2y + 7 \newline
-2y - 4 +2y &\ = -2y + 7 +2y \newline
-2y +2y - 4 &\ = -2y +2y + 7 \newline
- 4 &\ = 7 \newline
\end{align}
$$

The statement $-4 =7$ is false. The solution set is $\empty$ or $\{ \ \}$

### Identity
An identity is an equation that is satisfied for all values of the variable for which both sides of the equation are defined.

$$
\begin{align}
2(x - 5) + 1 &\ = 5x - (9 + 3x) \newline
2x - 10 + 1 &\ = 5x - 9 - 3x \newline
2x - 9 &\ = 2x - 9 \newline
\end{align}
$$

The solution set is the set of all real number

## Formula
A mathematical formula is an equation that describes how two or more variables are related.

$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
$$

</div>


## Solve for a variable
The expression “solve for a variable” means to isolate the variable with a coefficient of 1 on one side of the equation and all other variables and constants, if any, on the other side by forming equivalent equations.

<div style="background-color:#aaaaaa12; padding:10px">

Solve for h :
$$
\begin{align}  
A &\ = \frac{1}{2}bh \newline
2 (A) &\ = (\frac{1}{2}bh) \ 2 \newline
2A &\ = bh \newline
\frac{1}{b}(2A) &\ = (bh)\frac{1}{b} \newline
\frac{2A}{b} &\ = h
\end{align}
$$

</div>
